# Introduction

The CESK machine, developed by [Matthias Felleisen][], provides a simple and
powerful architecture used to model the semantics of functional, object-oriented
and imperative languages and features like mutation, recursion, exceptions,
continuations, garbage collection and multi-threading. It is a state-machine
that takes its name from the four components of each state: Control,
Environment, Store, and Kontinuation.

In this article, I detail the CESK machine and provide a partial implementation
of an interpreter for Dalvik bytecode - the language of Android.

# CESK

Being a state machine, CESK has a notion of jumping or stepping from one state
to another. In terms of sets, we can think of a program ($$p$$) as a set of
these machine states ($$\Sigma$$) that exist within the set of all machine
states ($$\mathit{Prog}$$) with a partial transition function (`step`) from
state to state ($$\Sigma \rightharpoonup \Sigma$$).

Defining the state-space, $$\Sigma$$ as $$\sigma\in\Sigma = Stmt^*\times
FP\times Store\times Kont$$, which allows us to encode a state as a simple
struct:

`(struct state {stmts fp store kont})`


## C.ontrol: A sequence of statements

The Control component of a CESK machine is a control string. In the lambda
calculus, the control string would be an expression. For Dalvik, we should think
of this component as a sequence of statements. This sequence of statements gives
an indication of which part of the program this state is.

## E.nvironment: Frame pointers

The Environment component of a CESK machine is a datastructure that maps
variables with an address. In the Dalvik CESK machine, we use simple frame
pointers as the addresses.

$$\rho\in\mathit{Env} = \mathit{Var}\rightharpoonup\mathit{Address}$$

### Addresses

Registers are offsets from frame pointers and map to local variables, we will
need to compute the location (frame offset) by pairing the frame pointer with
the name of a Dalvik register

$$FrameAddr = FramePointer\times Name\\ frameOffset : FramePointer\times Name
\to FrameAddr\\ frameOffset(fp, registerName) = (fp, registerName)$$

Objects and their fields are structurally equivalent to frame addresses.

$$FieldAddr = ObjectPointer\times Name\\ fieldOffset : ObjectPointer\times Name
\to FieldAddr\\ fieldOffset(op, fieldName) = (op, fieldName)$$

So the set of all addresses include both Object and Frame addresses:

$$a\in\mathit{Addr} = \mathit{FrameAddr}+\mathit{FieldAddr}$$

## S.tore: The Heap

The Store component of a CESK machine is a data structure that maps addresses to
values. In the Dalvik case, we map frame pointers to values.

$$ \sigma\in\mathit{Store} = \mathit{Address}\rightharpoonup\mathit{Value}\\
v\in\mathit{Value} = \mathit{Object} + \mathit{Boolean} + \mathit{Integer} +
\mathit{Null} $$

## K.ontinuations: The program stack (continuations)

The Kontinuation component of a CESK machine is essentially a program stack.
Within Dalvik, you find exception handlers and procedure calls - and with all
continuation based machines, the halt continuation to signify program
termination.

Each continuation is placed on a stack, where the top-most matching continuation
is found and executed: for exceptions this is the matching handler and for
assignment it is the next assignment continuation.

Halt is handled as a termination continuation without context encoded into the
component.

In the case of exceptions, Dalvik defines a type of exception (class name), the
branch label where execution should go and the next continuation.  $$
handle(className, label, \kappa) $$

Any other type of invocation affecting the program stack is an assignment
continuation, where the return context for a procedure call is encoded with the
register waiting for the result (name), the statement after the call, the frame
pointer from before the call and the next continuation.  $$ assign(name,
\vec{s}, fp, \kappa)$$


# Running the CESK machine

Since the CESK machine is a state-machine, we have a single partial transition
function (from state to state) that is run until it is told to terminate (when
we encounter the *halt* continuation) called `step`. We only need to have an
initial state ($$\varsigma_0$$) and then iterate until we hit *halt*. So, we
need four things:

* `inject` to create the initial state, with an empty environment and store
* `step` the transition function for each type of state transition
* `lookup` a way to lookup frame pointers in the store
* `run` run the CESK state-machine

{% codeblock dalvik_cesk.rkt lang:racket %}
(struct state {stmts fp store kont})

; create the initial machine state Ï‚0
(define (inject stmt)
  (state stmt empty-fp empty-store 'halt))

; the partial state to state transition function
(define (next state)
  (match state
    ...))

; lookup a frame-pointer in the store
(define (lookup store fp val)
  (hash-ref store `(,val ,fp)))

; the algorithm for running the interpreter
(define (run state)
  (let ([step (next state)])
    (if (eq? 'halt (kont step))
        step
        (run step))))
{% endcodeblock %}

# Transitions: Evaluation and stepping

Remembering from earilier in the article, there are three types of
continutations: assignment, handler, and halt. Each of the components of a
Dalvik program will use those generalized definitions.

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}
\kappa \in \mathit{Kont} &::=&
  assign(\mathit{name}, \vec{\mathit{s}}, \mathit{fp}, \kappa)
  \\
  & \mathrel{|} & handle(\mathit{className},\mathit{label},\kappa)
  \\
  & \mathrel{|} & halt
\end{array}
$$


## Assignment: Atomic statements/expressions

Atomic expressions are expressions which evaluation must terminate, never cause
and exception or side effect.

Atomic statements assign an atomic value to a variable, this involves evaluation
of the statement/expression, calculating the frame address and updating the
store.

To evaluate an atomic expression, we use the atomic expression evaluator:

$$
\mathcal{A} : AtomicExp \times \mathit{FP} \times \mathit{Store}
\rightharpoonup \mathit{Value}
$$

Then evaluation is simply knowing what the frame pointer offset is to do a
lookup of the atomic value. Since we have encoded this with the name of the
expression along with the frame pointer we have the frame address encoded into
the store.
{% codeblock aexp_eval.rkt lang:racket %}
(define (eval e fp store)
  (lookup store fp e))
{% endcodeblock %}
